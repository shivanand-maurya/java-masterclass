### ‚úÖ How to Use These for Practice:

For each program:

* Use **single-line comments** (`//`) to explain logic line by line.
* Use **multi-line comments** (`/* ... */`) to explain larger code blocks or logic sections.
* Use **Javadoc comments** (`/** ... */`) before class and method declarations to describe their purpose and parameters.
