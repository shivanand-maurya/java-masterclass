Here are some **practice exercises** to help you master Java operators. These exercises will cover various operator categories:

---

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators:**

* **Exercise 1:** Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Use the `width` and `height` values, and then apply arithmetic operators to find the area (`width * height`).

* **Exercise 2:** Write a program that calculates the total cost of 3 items in a shopping cart. The program should also calculate the tax (8%) and apply the discount (10%) using arithmetic operators.

---

### 2. **Relational Operators:**

* **Exercise 3:** Write a program that checks if a user is eligible to vote. The program should ask for the user's age and check if the age is greater than or equal to 18 using a relational operator.

* **Exercise 4:** Write a program that compares the heights of two people and prints if they are the same height, or one is taller than the other.

---

### 3. **Logical Operators:**

* **Exercise 5:** Write a program that checks whether a person is eligible for both a senior citizen discount (age â‰¥ 65) and a student discount (student status = true). Use logical operators (`&&` or `||`).

* **Exercise 6:** Write a program that evaluates if a number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive) using logical operators.

---

### 4. **Assignment Operators:**

* **Exercise 7:** Create a program that starts with a balance of 1000. Then, simulate a series of transactions (deposit, withdrawal) and keep updating the balance using assignment operators.

* **Exercise 8:** Write a program that starts with an initial salary of 5000. Increase the salary by 10% and then deduct a 5% tax using the assignment operators.

---

### 5. **Unary Operators:**

* **Exercise 9:** Write a program to simulate a countdown. Use the `--` operator to decrease a counter from 10 to 1, and print each step.

* **Exercise 10:** Write a program that checks whether a number is positive or negative using the unary `-` operator. Print the result for a number.

---

### 6. **Bitwise Operators:**

* **Exercise 11:** Write a program to perform bitwise AND, OR, and XOR on two integers. Display the results in both binary and decimal formats.

* **Exercise 12:** Write a program that demonstrates the effect of left and right shift operations on an integer. Print the original number and the result after shifting it left and right.

---

### 7. **Ternary Operator:**

* **Exercise 13:** Write a program that uses a ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd. Output "Even" or "Odd" accordingly.

* **Exercise 14:** Write a program that uses a ternary operator to find the maximum of two numbers and print the result.

---

### 8. **Instanceof Operator:**

* **Exercise 15:** Write a program to check the type of an object at runtime. Create a base class `Animal` and derived classes `Dog` and `Cat`. Use `instanceof` to check the type of the object.

* **Exercise 16:** Write a program that demonstrates the use of `instanceof` to check whether an object is an instance of an interface or a class. Create an interface `Playable` and two classes, `Guitar` and `Piano`. Check if the objects of these classes are instances of the `Playable` interface.

---

### Bonus Exercise:

* **Exercise 17:** Write a program that asks for a number from the user and prints whether the number is a prime number or not using a combination of relational, logical, and arithmetic operators.
