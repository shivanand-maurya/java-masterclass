         Imagine short as a medium-sized bag ðŸŽ’ that can carry a few thousand small items.
         If you try to add more than the maximum capacity, it overflows and starts from the beginning again.

        // Explanation:
        // 1. We declared a short variable 'population' and assigned it a value of 5000, representing a small village population.
        // 2. We demonstrated the short's range by setting 'minValue' to -32,768 and 'maxValue' to 32,767.
        // 3. The program outputs the values of 'population', 'minValue', and 'maxValue' to the console.
        // 4. We showed an example of overflow by incrementing 'overflowExample' beyond the short limit (32,767).
        // 5. When the short overflows, it wraps around to the negative side, demonstrating the overflow behavior in Java.
