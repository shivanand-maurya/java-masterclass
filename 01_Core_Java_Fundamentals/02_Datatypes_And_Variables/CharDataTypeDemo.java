         üß† Real-Life Analogy:
         Think of `char` as a post-it note üóíÔ∏è with a single symbol on it ‚Äî like a seat label, an emoji, or a letter from any language.
         Java's char supports **Unicode**, so it can store characters from most of the world's languages and even symbols.

        // Explanation:
        // 1. We declared a char variable 'seatLabel' to hold a single letter for a cinema seat.
        // 2. We used Unicode to represent a special symbol (¬©) and a Hindi character.
        // 3. 'char' in Java uses 2 bytes and supports a wide range of international characters.
        // 4. We displayed both the min and max Unicode values that a char can store.
        // 5. This shows how versatile 'char' is when dealing with globalized applications.
