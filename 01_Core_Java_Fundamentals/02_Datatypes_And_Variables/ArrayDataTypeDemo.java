         ðŸ§  Real-Life Analogy:
         Think of an array like a cricket scoreboard ðŸ“Š â€” a row of boxes, each storing the score of a player.
         You can go box by box, check any score, and update it. Arrays help you handle multiple values together.

        // Explanation:
        // 1. We created an array of integers to store cricket scores of 5 players.
        // 2. We accessed and printed each score using a loop.
        // 3. We calculated the highest score using simple iteration logic.
        // 4. This shows how arrays store and organize multiple values efficiently.
