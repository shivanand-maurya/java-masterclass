# Java – A Complete Learning Resource

Welcome to the **Java Learning Repository**, a comprehensive guide from fundamentals to advanced concepts. Java is a robust, platform-independent language (following the “Write Once, Run Anywhere” principle) and this repository structures Java learning in a clear, progressive way. It starts with Core Java basics (syntax, OOP, environment setup) and advances through Collections, multithreading, JDBC, modern Java 8+ features, and backend development (Spring, REST APIs). Each section is organized with explanations and examples, making it ideal for beginners, interview preparation, and backend developers alike. The resources here help build a strong foundation in Core Java and cover enterprise development concepts (Java EE) for large-scale applications.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

* **New Java Learners:** Complete beginners or students starting Java.
* **Interview Prep:** Anyone preparing for software interviews needing strong DSA and Java knowledge.
* **Backend Developers:** Developers building web services and microservices in Java (Spring/Spring Boot).
* **Educators & Enthusiasts:** Instructors and learners seeking a structured Java syllabus.

## Core Java Fundamentals

* **Java Basics & Setup:** History, features, and environment setup (installing JDK/JRE, understanding the JVM).
* **Syntax & Data Types:** Declaring variables, primitive vs. reference types, and using operators.
* **Control Flow:** Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`, enhanced `for`).
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
* **Methods & Constructors:** Defining methods (including overloading/overriding), constructors (default and parameterized), and using `this`/`super`.
* **Access Modifiers:** `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default scope, plus non-access modifiers (`static`, `final`, etc.).
* **Exception Handling:** Try/catch blocks, `throw`/`throws`, `finally`, and creating custom exceptions.
* **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files using `FileReader`, `FileWriter` (and other streams).

## Collections & Generics

* **Collections Framework:** Core interfaces (`List`, `Set`, `Map`) and common implementations (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`).
* **Iterators & Enhanced for-loop:** Traversing collections using `Iterator` and the `for-each` syntax.
* **Generics:** Parameterized types for classes and methods, enabling type-safe collections.
* **Utility Classes:** `Collections` and `Arrays` helper methods (sorting, searching), `Comparable`/`Comparator` for custom sorting.

## Multithreading & Concurrency

* **Thread Basics:** Creating threads (extending `Thread` or implementing `Runnable`), thread life cycle, and thread priorities.
* **Synchronization:** `synchronized` keyword, locks, the `volatile` modifier, and avoiding race conditions.
* **Concurrency Utilities:** High-level constructs in `java.util.concurrent` (thread pools, `ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, etc.).
* **Best Practices:** Thread-safe coding patterns, avoiding deadlocks and common pitfalls.

## JDBC & Databases

* **JDBC Basics:** Connecting Java to databases using JDBC – loading drivers, `Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `ResultSet`.
* **SQL Operations:** Executing queries for **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD) operations.
* **Transactions:** Commit/rollback control and error handling with transactions.
* **ORM Overview:** Introduction to Java Persistence API (JPA) and Hibernate for object-relational mapping (optional).
* **Connection Pooling:** (Briefly) using connection pools for efficient resource management.

## Java 8+ Features

* **Lambda Expressions:** Anonymous functions introduced in Java 8 for concise syntax (e.g. `(x) -> x*2`).
* **Streams API:** Functional-style operations on collections (stream pipelines with `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, etc.).
* **Default and Static Methods:** Enhancements to interfaces (adding default method implementations).
* **Date & Time API:** New `java.time` package (`LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, etc.) for robust date/time handling.
* **Optional:** Container to handle potentially missing values without `null`.
* **Other Enhancements:** Method references (`Class::method`), `CompletableFuture`, and more.

## Frameworks & Backend Development

* **Servlets & JSP:** Basics of Java web applications (servlet lifecycle, request/response, JSP for dynamic pages).
* **Spring Framework:** Core concepts like Dependency Injection, bean configuration, and Spring MVC for building web apps.
* **Spring Boot:** Rapid application development using Spring Boot (auto-configuration, embedded servers). **REST APIs:** Creating RESTful services with Spring Boot (controllers, path variables, request bodies).
* **Spring Data JPA:** Simplified database access and repository patterns for ORM (using Hibernate under the hood).
* **Spring Security:** Fundamentals of securing Java applications (authentication, authorization, basic configurations).
* **Microservices:** (Introduction) Building and deploying microservices with Spring Cloud (service discovery, API gateways), if included.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

* **Basic Data Structures:** Arrays, **String** manipulations, dynamic arrays (`ArrayList`), linked lists, stacks, queues.
* **Trees & Graphs:** Binary trees, binary search trees, tree/trie traversals; graph representations (adjacency list/matrix) and search (DFS/BFS).
* **Hashing & Heaps:** Hash maps/sets for fast lookup, priority queues (heaps) for scheduling algorithms.
* **Sorting & Searching:** Common algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick sort) and binary search on sorted data.
* **Algorithmic Paradigms:** Recursion, **Dynamic Programming**, Greedy algorithms, backtracking (e.g., subsets, permutations).
* **Complexity Analysis:** Time and space complexity (Big O notation) for comparing algorithms – a key skill for interviews.
* **Practice Problems:** Example interview-style problems covering these topics to apply the concepts.
